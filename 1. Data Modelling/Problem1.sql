Approach:
--------
Below is the the data model assumed for the weather data records will consist of a single table with the following columns:
station_id - a unique identifier for the weather station (text)
date - the date of the weather record (date)
max_temp - the maximum temperature for that day (numeric)
min_temp - the minimum temperature for that day (numeric)
precipitation - the amount of precipitation for that day (numeric)
Here the primary key will be a combination of station_id and date to ensure that each weather record is unique to a specific station on a specific date. 
Here is the DDL of the weather data table.

CREATE TABLE weather_data (
  station_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  max_temp NUMERIC,
  min_temp NUMERIC,
  precipitation NUMERIC,
  PRIMARY KEY (station_id, date)
);
